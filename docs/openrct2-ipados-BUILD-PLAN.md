# OpenRCT2 Touch — Master Build Plan
### A native iPadOS port of OpenRCT2 (Apple Pencil + touch-first)

**Project name:** OpenRCT2Touch (display: "OpenRCT2 Touch") — an unofficial, community iPad port of OpenRCT2. Repo/codename: `openrct2-touch`.
**Author:** Chris (with Claude)
**Date:** July 13, 2026
**Companion doc:** `openrct2-ipados-feasibility.md` (the research/verdict). This document is the *how*.
**Status:** Pre-flight. Nothing built yet. This is the guide an AI coding agent (and you) follow from empty folder to working demo.

---

## 0. How to read this document

This is a build bible, not a quick-start. It is deliberately exhaustive so an agent can execute long stretches without you, and so *you* always know what "done" looks like at each gate.

Structure:
- **§1–4** — what we're building, the strategy, what you need before starting, and the all-important `ref/` folder for the copyrighted game data.
- **§5–7** — repo layout, the upstream code you're grafting onto, and the build-system plan.
- **§8** — the phase-by-phase engineering plan. This is the spine. Each phase has: **Goal · Files · Tasks · Exit criteria · Who drives (agent vs. you)**.
- **§9–10** — the automation harness and the `AGENTS.md` you hand the agent.
- **§11–15** — testing, distribution/legal, risk register, definition of done, and an appendix with the exact file inventory + command reference.

**Two rules that never bend:**
1. **Never commit or bundle the RCT2 game data.** It lives in `ref/` locally, is git-ignored, and is only ever *staged* into a build for your own testing. Shipping it is copyright infringement. (§4, §12.)
2. **macOS-headless-first.** The agent proves everything it can on a fast, deterministic desktop build before touching the iPad. iOS is the *outer* loop. (§2.)

---

## 1. What we're building

A **native iPadOS port of OpenRCT2** — the open-source RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 engine — with touch-first and Apple Pencil controls. Not RCT Classic. Not streaming. Not a VM. A real ARM64 app that runs on the iPad's own silicon.

### 1.1 Definition of done (the MVP demo)
The project is "done enough to show" when, on a physical iPad:
1. The app launches natively (no VM/stream), shows the OpenRCT2 title screen.
2. The user has imported their **own** RCT2 data via the Files app, and a scenario loads.
3. You can **build a working coaster and place scenery** using touch + Apple Pencil, at a playable frame rate (≥ 30 fps on a mid-park).
4. Pinch-zoom and two-finger pan work; windows are usable.
5. **Bonus / the "why not just buy Classic" shot:** one community **plugin** or **custom scenario** loads on-device.

Everything else (polish, multiplayer UX, App Store) is out of scope for v1.

### 1.2 Explicit non-goals for v1
- Public App Store release (blocked by GPLv3 — see §12).
- Bundling any game assets.
- The OpenGL hardware renderer on iOS (we use the software renderer — §8 Phase 4).
- SDL3 migration (upstream is mid-migration; we stay on SDL2).
- Rewriting the in-engine UI. We *adapt input*, we don't rebuild windows.

## 2. Strategy & guiding principles

These decisions shape every phase. Read them once; they explain the "why" behind the ordering.

**2.1 Two loops, different speeds.** There is a fast inner loop (macOS, headless, seconds) and a slow outer loop (iPad, device, minutes + human). The agent lives in the inner loop and only promotes known-good builds outward.

| Loop | Target | Speed | Who | Verifies |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Inner | macOS from source, `--headless` | seconds | agent, unattended | compiles, boots, loads park, simulates, no crash |
| Middle | iOS Simulator | ~10–30s | agent, mostly unattended | boots, renders UI, asset import, input plumbing |
| Outer | Physical iPad | ~1–2 min + hands | you + agent | perf, memory, Pencil, touch *feel* |

**2.2 macOS-from-source is the keystone.** Before any iOS work, get OpenRCT2 building from source on your Mac and running with all data paths pointed into the repo (§8 Phase 1). This gives the agent a self-contained, reproducible target it can hammer. Most logic bugs surface here, cheaply.

**2.3 Reuse the Apple code that already exists.** OpenRCT2 already has `Platform.macOS.mm`, `Platform.Posix.cpp`, and `UiContext.macOS.mm`. iOS is Darwin + UIKit. You are extending an Apple/POSIX path, not inventing one. SDL2 already ships an iOS backend. The Android port already proves the "SDL owns the window, runs C++ `main`" pattern on mobile.

**2.4 Gate the human-only work.** Three things an agent cannot do alone: (a) physically wire the iPad + approve signing, (b) build the iOS dependency binaries the first time (fiddly, weak signal), (c) judge whether controls *feel* good. Every phase marks whether it's agent-drivable or needs you.

**2.5 Small, reversible commits.** Every task is a commit with a green build. The agent must never leave the **working branch** red. Use a branch per phase, cut from the pinned base (§2.6).

**2.6 We work inside the fork (decided).** The project lives in the fork **`chrissotraidis/OpenRCT2Touch`** (forked from `OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2`, GPL-3.0). This is a real GitHub fork, *not* a fresh repo with a submodule — so the entire upstream tree (`src/`, `data/`, `cmake/`, `distribution/`, …) is already present at the repo root, and all iOS work is added *alongside* it (in `/ios`, `/scripts`, etc.). The `develop` branch is kept as a clean mirror of upstream for syncing; **all port work happens on a dedicated branch** (`ipad`). Pin that branch's base to a known-good commit/tag (a release tag like `v0.5.2`/`v0.5.3`, or a specific recent `develop` SHA) so a moving upstream can't break the build under you.

**2.7 Fork & git etiquette (the agent MUST follow this).** This is a public, GPL-licensed community project. Being a good fork is a hard requirement, not a nicety:
- **Never commit to `develop`.** Treat it as read-only upstream mirror. All work lands on the `ipad` working branch (and short-lived phase branches merged into it).
- **Never push to `OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2`. Never open a pull request against upstream.** This is a standalone fork; do not touch their issue tracker or PR queue.
- **Preserve provenance.** Keep every upstream `LICENSE`/`licence.txt`, per-file copyright header, and `contributors.md` intact. Never strip or rewrite them.
- **Keep the "forked from" link.** Don't detach the fork or rewrite `develop`'s history. No force-pushes to shared branches.
- **Mark your changes.** Prefix port commits so they're distinguishable from upstream, e.g. `[touch] Phase 3: add UiContext.iOS.mm`. State what changed (GPLv3 asks for this).
- **Attribute, don't imply endorsement.** The `README` credits OpenRCT2 up top and states clearly this is an unofficial, community port not affiliated with the OpenRCT2 team.
- **Sync deliberately.** When pulling upstream, update `develop` from upstream, then rebase/merge `ipad` onto a chosen pinned point — never blind-merge a moving target mid-phase.
- **Assets are sacred (see §4).** Never commit, never push, never package `/ref` or any RCT2 game data. If a change would put game assets into a tracked file or a distributable artifact — stop, it's a hard error.

---

## 3. Prerequisites

### 3.1 Hardware
- A **Mac with Apple Silicon** (M-series). Builds the engine, runs the Simulator, drives the device loop.
- A **physical iPad** — ideally an **M-series iPad Pro** (for Apple Pencil hover + headroom). A USB-C cable for tethered install/log.
- An **Apple Pencil** (2nd gen / Pro) for the Pencil features.
- Optional but recommended: a **Magic Keyboard/trackpad** for the iPad (unlocks the fastest "it just plays like the PC" milestone).

### 3.2 Accounts
- A free **Apple ID** is enough to start (build + run on *your* iPad; 7-day cert churn — see feasibility doc §6).
- Upgrade to the **$99 Apple Developer Program** only when you want TestFlight or to hand a build to anyone else. Not needed day one.

### 3.3 Software (install on the Mac)
- **Xcode** (latest) + Command Line Tools. Provides `xcodebuild`, `xcrun devicectl`, the iOS SDK, the Simulator, Metal toolchain.
- **Homebrew**, then: `cmake`, `ninja`, `pkg-config`, `git`, `ios-deploy`, `libimobiledevice` (`idevicesyslog`, `idevicecrashreport`), `create-dmg` (optional).
- Upstream OpenRCT2 macOS build deps (Homebrew): the project documents these; expect `sdl2`, `speexdsp`(legacy—may be gone), `freetype`, `fontconfig`, `libpng`, `libzip`, `openssl`, `icu4c`, `jansson`/`nlohmann-json`, `flac`, `libvorbis`, `libogg`, `zlib`, `zstd`, `nasm`. (The agent should read upstream's own `readme.txt` / macOS CI to get the *current* exact list — this is a moving target.)

> **Agent note:** verify the current dependency set from the repo's `distribution/readme.txt` and `.github/workflows/*.yml` (macOS job) rather than trusting any static list, including this one.

---

## 4. The `ref/` folder — copyrighted game data

This is the folder Chris asked about specifically. It is where the **original RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 data files** live so the engine (and the agent's tests) can reference them. OpenRCT2 is an engine reimplementation; it cannot run without these.

### 4.1 What goes in it
The contents of a legitimate **RCT2** install (Steam / GOG / CD) — critically the `Data/` folder containing `g1.dat`, plus `ObjData/`, `Tracks/`, `Landscapes/`, `Scenarios/`, `Saved Games/`, and the `Data/*.dat` audio. OpenRCT2 validates the path by checking for `Data/g1.dat` (confirmed in `RootCommands.cpp` → `set-rct2`). RCT Classic data is also accepted by upstream as an alternative source; RCT1 data is optional (enables extra content).

### 4.2 How to get it onto the Mac
Buy RCT2 on **GOG** or **Steam** (cheap), install on a PC/Mac, and copy the install directory into `ref/rct2/`. On GOG the layout already looks like `.../RollerCoaster Tycoon 2/Data/g1.dat`. That's the folder you point `--rct2-data-path` at.

### 4.3 Structure
```
ref/                      # git-ignored in its entirety
├── rct2/                 # a full RCT2 install; must contain Data/g1.dat
│   ├── Data/
│   ├── ObjData/
│   ├── Tracks/
│   └── ...
├── rct1/                 # OPTIONAL original RCT1 install (Data/csg1.dat)
└── README.md             # NOT ignored: explains what to put here + legal note
```
Only `ref/README.md` is committed (a placeholder telling a future you/collaborator what belongs here and that it must be their own copy). Everything else under `ref/` is git-ignored.

### 4.4 The rules
- **`ref/` is git-ignored.** Never committed, never pushed.
- **`ref/` is never packaged into a shippable artifact.** Not into the macOS app for distribution, not into the iOS `.ipa` you'd give anyone. (For your *own* on-device testing you may stage a copy into the sandbox — that's fine because it never leaves your devices.)
- The **real** iOS onboarding is a Files-app import (§8 Phase 5). `ref/` is a developer convenience that stands in for "the user imported their copy," so the agent can test without a human tapping through a document picker every run.

## 5. Repository layout

This is the fork **`chrissotraidis/OpenRCT2Touch`** — the whole upstream tree is already present at the repo root. Your additions sit *alongside* it, and the port's engine/UI source files go **into the upstream dirs where they belong** (so CMake compiles them beside `Platform.macOS.mm`). Everything the build/tests reference lives under the repo root. All committed on the **`ipad`** branch, never `develop`.

### 5.1 `.gitignore` — APPEND to the upstream file (don't overwrite it)
The fork already ships an upstream `.gitignore`; preserve it and append:
```
# ═══ OpenRCT2Touch additions ═══
ref/                    # copyrighted RCT2 data — NEVER commit
!ref/README.md          # keep only the placeholder explaining what goes here

**/DerivedData/
.DS_Store
```

## 6. Upstream architecture you're grafting onto

The agent must understand these load-bearing files before editing. All paths are relative to the fork's repo root (e.g. `src/openrct2/`). (Verified against `develop`, July 2026.)

### 6.1 The two libraries + the app
- **`src/openrct2/`** — `libopenrct2`, the engine (platform-agnostic core + a thin per-OS `platform/` layer).
- **`src/openrct2-ui/`** — `libopenrct2ui`, the SDL2-based front end: window/context, input, the software+OpenGL drawing engines, and the in-engine window system.
- **`src/openrct2/`** also builds the CLI/`main` entry; the macOS app wraps it in an `.app`.

### 6.2 Filesystem resolution (already mapped — see feasibility doc)
- **`src/openrct2/PlatformEnvironment.cpp` / `.h`** — the single resolver. Seven roots (`DirBase`: rct1, rct2, openrct2, user, config, cache, documentation). Everything the engine reads/writes goes through here. Physical locations come from the `Platform::` layer + config + CLI overrides.

### 6.3 The per-OS platform layer (where iOS files are added)
Directory `src/openrct2/platform/`:
```
Platform.h             # the interface (GetInstallPath, GetFolderPath, GetAssetPath, ...)
Platform.Common.cpp    # shared
Platform.Posix.cpp     # POSIX shared (Linux+macOS+iOS can share much of this)
Platform.macOS.mm      # Cocoa/Foundation path resolution  ← closest template for iOS
Platform.Linux.cpp
Platform.Win32.cpp
Platform.Android.cpp   # mobile precedent (external storage, asset dir)
Platform.Emscripten.cpp
```
→ **You add `Platform.iOS.mm`** (or extend `Platform.macOS.mm` with `TARGET_OS_IOS` guards). It returns sandbox paths for `GetFolderPath(userData/userConfig/userCache)`, the app bundle for `GetInstallPath()`/`GetAssetPath()`.

### 6.4 The UI / SDL context (where the window + input live)
Directory `src/openrct2-ui/`:
```
UiContext.cpp          # the big cross-platform SDL window/context (36 KB)
UiContext.macOS.mm     # macOS-specific glue  ← template for iOS
UiContext.Android.cpp  # mobile glue (tap=click hacks live in this world)
UiContext.Win32.cpp / .Linux.cpp
input/                 # mouse/keyboard/shortcut handling  ← touch/Pencil/GCMouse hook in here
drawing/               # drawing engines incl. opengl/ (the GL 3.3 renderer to bypass)
CursorRepository.*     # hardware cursors (mostly moot on touch)
TextComposition.*      # IME/text input  ← wire to iOS on-screen keyboard
```
→ **You add `UiContext.iOS.mm`** and extend `input/` for touch/Pencil/GameController.

### 6.5 Command line / run modes (the harness's best friend)
- **`src/openrct2/command_line/RootCommands.cpp`** — defines the flags and subcommands. Confirmed useful ones:
  - `--rct2-data-path`, `--rct1-data-path`, `--openrct2-data-path`, `--user-data-path` (absolute path overrides for the roots)
  - `--headless` (sets `gOpenRCT2Headless` + `gOpenRCT2NoGraphics`)
  - subcommands: `screenshot`, `simulate`, `sprite`, `parkinfo`, `scan-objects`, `set-rct2`
- These are how the agent runs deterministic, GUI-less smoke tests on macOS (§9).

### 6.6 Scripting (plugins)
- **`src/openrct2/scripting/`** + vendored **`src/thirdparty/quickjs-ng/`** — the JS plugin engine. **quickjs-ng is a no-JIT bytecode interpreter** (swapped in from Duktape in v0.5.0, PR #23465). It compiles cleanly for iOS and needs no special entitlement. This is the debunked "JIT blocker."

### 6.7 The Android port (the blueprint to imitate)
- **`src/openrct2-android/`** — Gradle project. `GameActivity extends org.libsdl.app.SDLActivity`; native lib load order in `getLibraries()`; assets bundled in APK since v0.5.0; RCT2 data read from `/sdcard/rct2`. The iOS equivalent: a UIKit shell that starts SDL, engine data in the bundle, RCT2 data imported into the sandbox.

---

## 7. Build-system plan

### 7.1 The shape of the iOS build
OpenRCT2 uses **CMake**. Two viable routes; pick **A**:

- **Route A (recommended): CMake → Xcode generator + an iOS toolchain file.** Use a maintained `ios.toolchain.cmake` (e.g. the widely-used `leetal/ios-cmake`) to set `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS`, architectures, deployment target, and bitcode/sim flags. Generate an Xcode project for `libopenrct2` + `libopenrct2ui` as static libraries, then link them into the hand-written UIKit app (`ios/App`). This keeps the engine building via its own CMake while the app shell is a normal Xcode target.
- **Route B: pure `xcodebuild` of a hand-maintained project** that compiles the engine sources directly. More control, more drift from upstream. Avoid unless Route A fights you.

### 7.2 Dependencies for iOS (the hard part)
Every native lib the engine links must exist as an **iOS static lib / `.xcframework`**, built twice (device `arm64`, simulator `arm64`). Options, in order of preference:
1. **Prebuilt where possible.** SDL2 ships an official iOS `.xcframework`. ICU, freetype, libpng, zlib, etc. can be built with established scripts.
2. **`vcpkg` with an iOS triplet** (`arm64-ios`, `arm64-ios-simulator`) for the long tail. This is likely the fastest path to a full set and is script-friendly for the agent.
3. **Hand-rolled build scripts** as a fallback for anything vcpkg lacks.

Output lands in `vendor/ios-arm64/` and `vendor/ios-sim-arm64/`, which the CMake/Xcode target adds to its search paths. **This is Phase 2 and the single most likely place to stall — budget for it and drive it with the agent, not autonomously.**

### 7.3 Feature flags to set for iOS
- `DISABLE_OPENGL=ON` (use software renderer; skip GL 3.3 core path).
- `DISABLE_NETWORK` / `DISABLE_HTTP` — start **ON** (disabled) to shrink the dependency set for first boot; re-enable later for multiplayer/plugins-from-URL.
- `ENABLE_SCRIPTING=ON` (quickjs-ng; keep plugins — they work).
- `DISABLE_TTF` — decide based on whether you ship freetype early; keep font rendering if feasible.
- Breakpad/crash handler — off initially; iOS has its own crash reports.

---

## 8. The phase-by-phase engineering plan

Each phase is a branch. Do not advance until **Exit criteria** are green. "Driver" = who does the work.

---

### Phase 0 — Repo & tooling bootstrap
**Goal:** the fork is cloned, the `ipad` branch exists, scaffolding is added, and upstream builds *unmodified* on macOS.
**Driver:** you + agent.
**Status:** fork already created at `chrissotraidis/OpenRCT2Touch` ✅.
**Files:** `scripts/env.sh`, `scripts/bootstrap.sh`, appended `.gitignore`, `ref/README.md`, `README-touch.md`, `AGENTS.md` (stub), plus the new `ios/ scripts/ vendor/ ref/ assets/ runtime/ testdata/ build/` dirs.
**Tasks:**
1. `git clone` your fork locally. `git remote -v` should show your fork as `origin`. Add upstream as a read-only remote for syncing only: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2` — **never push to it, never PR to it.**
2. **Create and check out the working branch** from a pinned base: `git checkout -b ipad v0.5.3` (a release tag) or a specific `develop` SHA. Leave `develop` as the untouched upstream mirror. **All work happens on `ipad`.**
3. Add the new dirs (§5) and **append** the port `.gitignore` block (§5.1) to the upstream `.gitignore`. **Confirm `ref/` is ignored (`git status`) before any commit that could touch game data.**
4. `scripts/env.sh` exports `ROOT`, `RCT2_DATA=$ROOT/ref/rct2`, `OPENRCT2_DATA=$ROOT/assets/engine`, `USER_DATA=$ROOT/runtime/user`.
5. `scripts/bootstrap.sh`: `brew install` deps, verify Xcode + CLI tools, assert current branch is `ipad`, assert `ref/` is untracked/ignored, verify `ref/rct2/Data/g1.dat` exists (warn if not).
6. Write `README-touch.md`: credit OpenRCT2 up top, "unofficial community port, not affiliated with the OpenRCT2 team," link upstream; keep `licence.txt`/`contributors.md` intact.
7. First commit on `ipad`, prefixed: `[touch] Phase 0: scaffolding + harness`.
**Exit criteria:** on branch `ipad`; `develop` untouched; `bootstrap.sh` runs clean; `ref/` present and confirmed git-ignored; a first `[touch]`-prefixed commit exists. (Phase 1 proves the actual build.)

---

### Phase 1 — macOS-from-source baseline (the keystone)
**Goal:** build OpenRCT2 from source and run it fully repo-local, including headless. This is the agent's fast loop; it must exist before iOS.
**Driver:** agent (you unblock brew issues).
**Files:** `scripts/build-macos.sh`, `scripts/run-macos-headless.sh`, `assets/engine/` populated by the build.
**Tasks:**
1. Configure + build upstream via CMake for macOS (native arm64). Produce the `openrct2` binary and the engine data (`assets/engine`).
2. `run-macos-headless.sh`: launch with all four `--*-data-path` flags pointed into the repo + `--headless simulate testdata/parks/smoke.sc6 1000`.
3. Add a GUI run script too (windowed) for your own eyeballing.
4. Capture a **baseline screenshot** via the `screenshot` subcommand for later visual diffs.
**Exit criteria:** headless run loads a park, simulates N ticks, exits 0, no crash. A windowed run plays with mouse/keyboard on the Mac using only repo-local data (nothing in `~/Library`). **This proves the whole data-path + harness model before iOS risk.**

---

### Phase 2 — iOS dependency toolchain (the pit)
**Goal:** every engine dependency exists as an iOS static lib for device + simulator.
**Driver:** **you + agent, closely.** Weak automated signal; expect iteration.
**Files:** `ios/toolchain/ios.toolchain.cmake`, `scripts/build-ios-deps.sh`, `vendor/ios-*/`.
**Tasks:**
1. Stand up the toolchain file (leetal/ios-cmake or equivalent).
2. Get SDL2's iOS `.xcframework`.
3. Build/obtain ICU, freetype, libpng, zlib, zstd, libzip, and (if kept) FLAC/ogg/vorbis, OpenSSL for both slices. Prefer vcpkg iOS triplets; script the rest.
4. Record exact versions + build flags in `vendor/MANIFEST.md` for reproducibility.
**Exit criteria:** a trivial C++ test target links against all of them and builds for `arm64-ios` and `arm64-ios-simulator`. (Don't involve the engine yet — isolate the dependency variable.)

---

### Phase 3 — iOS app shell + SDL boots to title (Simulator)
**Goal:** the engine runs under a UIKit app and reaches the title screen in the Simulator.
**Driver:** agent (you approve first device/sim run).
**Files:** `ios/App/*` (Xcode project, `AppDelegate`, root VC, `Info.plist`, entitlements), `ios/platform/UiContext.iOS.mm` (stub), CMake iOS target linking `libopenrct2` + `libopenrct2ui` + `vendor/` libs.
**Tasks:**
1. Create the UIKit app target. Mirror the SDL2 iOS template: SDL provides the `UIApplicationMain`/`SDL_main` bridge (the iOS analog of Android's `SDLActivity`). Confirm whether to use SDL's `SDL_uikit` main shim or a custom `AppDelegate` that hands off to `SDL_main`.
2. Link the engine static libs + deps. Resolve the inevitable missing-symbol/framework errors (UIKit, Metal, AudioToolbox, AVFoundation, GameController, CoreHaptics).
3. Bundle a minimal set of engine data (`assets/engine`) into `App/Resources` so `GetInstallPath()`/`GetAssetPath()` can find it (Phase 5 makes this robust).
4. Get it to launch in the **Simulator** and reach the title/intro (which needs engine data but not RCT2 data).
**Exit criteria:** app launches in the iPad Simulator and shows OpenRCT2's title screen (or a clean "no RCT2 data" prompt). Logs stream via Xcode console. No RCT2 data required yet.

---

### Phase 4 — Rendering: software renderer → Metal surface
**Goal:** the in-engine UI draws correctly on iOS via the software renderer; the GL path is disabled.
**Driver:** agent.
**Files:** CMake flags (`DISABLE_OPENGL=ON`), possibly small edits in `openrct2-ui/drawing/` and `UiContext.iOS.mm`.
**Tasks:**
1. Force the software drawing engine on iOS. Ensure the engine's framebuffer is uploaded to an `SDL_Texture` backed by Metal and presented (SDL's iOS renderer uses Metal by default).
2. Handle Retina scale (points vs. pixels), safe-area insets, and orientation (lock to landscape for v1).
3. Verify colors/palette and no tearing.
**Exit criteria:** title screen + an in-engine window render pixel-correct in the Simulator at Retina scale, landscape, correct aspect. Frame presented through Metal.

---

### Phase 5 — Filesystem, sandbox & asset import
**Goal:** real path resolution on iOS + the user-facing RCT2 import flow, with `ref/` as the dev stand-in.
**Driver:** agent (you test the real Files import once).
**Files:** `ios/platform/Platform.iOS.mm`, `scripts/stage-assets.sh`, a small import UI in `ios/App`.
**Tasks:**
1. Implement `Platform.iOS.mm`: `GetInstallPath()`/`GetAssetPath()` → app bundle; `GetFolderPath(userData/userConfig/userCache)` → sandbox `Documents`/`Library`. Add the iOS branch to `GetOpenRCT2DirectoryName()` semantics as needed.
2. `stage-assets.sh`: copy `assets/engine` → `App/Resources`; for **dev/test builds only**, copy `ref/rct2` → the app's sandbox `Documents/rct2` and seed `runtime/user` → sandbox, then set `Config::Get().general.rct2Path` accordingly (or call the equivalent of `set-rct2`).
3. Implement the **real** import path: `UIDocumentPickerViewController` (folder import) + security-scoped bookmarks → copy/reference RCT2 data into the sandbox → write `rct2Path` to `config.ini`. Expose the app's `Documents` in the Files app (`UIFileSharingEnabled` / `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace`).
4. First-run UX: detect missing/invalid RCT2 data (no `Data/g1.dat`) → show import screen.
**Exit criteria:** with `ref/`-staged data, a real scenario loads on device/sim end-to-end. Separately, the manual Files-app import flow works once, by hand, on a real iPad.

---

### Phase 6 — Input I: pointer, keyboard, mouse (playable fast)
**Goal:** fully playable with a Magic Keyboard/trackpad or mouse — the quickest "it plays like the PC" milestone.
**Driver:** agent (you smoke-test with hardware).
**Files:** `openrct2-ui/input/*` extensions, `UiContext.iOS.mm`.
**Tasks:**
1. Wire **`GCMouse`** (Game Controller framework): left/right/middle buttons, scroll, delta coords → the engine's existing mouse input. Right-click is the workhorse; get it mapped.
2. Wire **`GCKeyboard`** → OpenRCT2 keyboard shortcuts.
3. Optionally adopt `UIPointerInteraction` for a polite system cursor when not captured.
4. Route SDL's iOS mouse events if simpler than GameController for v1 — evaluate both.
**Exit criteria:** on a real iPad with keyboard/trackpad (or mouse), you can play a scenario end-to-end: build a coaster, place scenery, use shortcuts. This is a legitimate demo on its own.

---

### Phase 7 — Input II: touch controls
**Goal:** finger-only play is genuinely usable (not the Android tap=click hack).
**Driver:** agent builds; **you judge feel.**
**Files:** `openrct2-ui/input/*` (new touch gesture layer), `UiContext.iOS.mm`.
**Tasks (map per feasibility doc §4.2):**
1. One-finger drag pan on terrain; **two-finger drag = pan** even in build mode; **pinch = zoom**; double-tap zoom-to-point.
2. **Long-press = right-click / context menu.** Consider a persistent Build/Demolish mode toggle so the common secondary action becomes a primary tap.
3. Tap-to-place with a **confirm affordance** (don't rely on precise release).
4. Enlarge UI hit targets; drag-window-to-edge to dismiss; make in-engine windows finger-usable.
5. Multi-select via a dedicated tool with drag-rectangle.
**Exit criteria:** you can complete the MVP demo (build coaster, place scenery, navigate) **with fingers only**, and it feels acceptable. Iterate with the agent on the rough spots.

---

### Phase 8 — Apple Pencil (the differentiator)
**Goal:** the screenshot-worthy interactions that RCT Classic can't do.
**Driver:** agent builds; **you judge feel** (needs Pencil hardware).
**Files:** `openrct2-ui/input/*` (Pencil layer), `UiContext.iOS.mm`.
**Tasks:**
1. Treat Pencil as the **fine cursor** (precise placement) vs. finger = camera/gesture. Read `UITouch.type == .pencil`, `force`, `altitudeAngle`, `azimuthAngle`.
2. **Terrain painting:** pressure → brush strength, tilt → brush size, on the land tools.
3. **Draw coaster track:** freehand a Pencil stroke that snaps to legal track pieces. (Highest-effort, highest-payoff. Prototype crudely first.)
4. **Path building:** drag to lay a path run snapped to grid.
5. **Hover preview (M2+ iPad):** `UIHoverGestureRecognizer` / adopt `UIPointerInteraction` to reproduce mouse-hover tooltips + ghost placement.
**Exit criteria:** Pencil terrain-paint + at least a rough "draw track" demo work on device; hover tooltips appear on an M-series iPad. This is the demo's hero moment.

---

### Phase 9 — On-device performance, memory, stability
**Goal:** playable frame rate and no memory crashes on a real iPad, on a non-trivial park.
**Driver:** agent (automated perf capture) + you.
**Files:** profiling scripts, targeted engine tweaks.
**Tasks:**
1. Profile with Metal System Trace / Instruments; measure fps on a medium and large park.
2. Watch memory ceiling (the C&C port hit 3 GB+ and crashed on long sessions — RCT parks can be large). Fix leaks/peaks; consider capping park size or view distance on iOS.
3. Stress: long session, rapid zoom, big coaster. Fix top crashes from `idevicecrashreport`.
**Exit criteria:** ≥ 30 fps on a mid-size park; a 30-minute session doesn't OOM; top-3 device crashes fixed.

---

### Phase 10 — Plugins, custom content, packaging
**Goal:** prove the OpenRCT2-vs-Classic differentiators on-device, then package for TestFlight/sideload.
**Driver:** agent + you.
**Files:** `testdata/plugins/`, `testdata/parks/`, packaging scripts, entitlements/provisioning.
**Tasks:**
1. Load a sample **JS plugin** on-device (proves quickjs-ng runs interpreted on iOS — the debunked-JIT victory lap).
2. Load a **custom scenario / community park** on-device.
3. (Optional) re-enable networking for a multiplayer smoke test.
4. Package: signed build; TestFlight (if paid account) or sideload via free provisioning; document the exact `xcodebuild archive` + export steps.
**Exit criteria:** the full MVP demo (§1.1) runs on a physical iPad, including a plugin/custom-scenario. A build is installable on a second device via your chosen channel.

---

## 9. The automation harness

This is what lets the agent "chew through it." The principle: **every change ends in a command that returns a machine-readable pass/fail.**

### 9.1 Fast inner loop (macOS, unattended)
`scripts/run-macos-headless.sh`:
```bash
source scripts/env.sh
"$ROOT/build/macos/openrct2" \
  --rct2-data-path "$RCT2_DATA" \
  --openrct2-data-path "$OPENRCT2_DATA" \
  --user-data-path "$USER_DATA" \
  --headless \
  simulate "$ROOT/testdata/parks/smoke.sc6" 5000
echo "exit=$?"
```
Wrap in a script that: builds → runs headless simulate on several parks → runs `screenshot` and diffs against a baseline → greps logs for `assert`/`FATAL` → returns non-zero on any failure. The agent loops: edit → this → read failure → patch.

### 9.2 Middle loop (Simulator)
`scripts/build-ios.sh sim` → `xcrun simctl boot` → `install` → `launch --console`. Good for UI/plumbing/asset-import checks without hardware. Mostly agent-drivable.

### 9.3 Outer loop (device)
`scripts/install-run-ios.sh`:
- Build: `xcodebuild -scheme OpenRCT2Touch -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' ...`
- Install + launch (iOS 17+): `xcrun devicectl device install app --device <UDID> <app>` then `... process launch --console --terminate-existing --device <UDID> <bundle-id>`
- iOS ≤16 fallback: `ios-deploy --debug --bundle <app>`
- Logs: `--console` (stdout) + `idevicesyslog` (system)
- Crashes: `scripts/collect-crash.sh` → `idevicecrashreport -e /tmp/crash` → parse newest `.ips`.

### 9.4 What the agent watches for
- Build failure (compiler/linker) → parse, fix, rebuild.
- Boot failure / assert / `FATAL` in logs → patch.
- Crash report present → symbolicate top frame → patch.
- Screenshot diff beyond threshold → flag for **human** (visual regressions need eyes).
- Perf below target → flag for human + capture trace.

### 9.5 The human gates (agent must stop and ask)
- First device provisioning / signing trust.
- Any "does this *feel* right" judgment (Phases 7–8).
- Dependency-build dead ends (Phase 2) after N failed attempts.
- Anything touching `ref/` staging into a *distributable* artifact (should never happen — hard stop).

---

## 10. `AGENTS.md` — what to hand the agent

Keep it short, imperative, and pointing here for depth. Contents:

1. **Mission:** port OpenRCT2 to native iPadOS; success = MVP demo (§1.1).
2. **Golden rules (non-negotiable):**
   - **Assets:** never commit, push, or package `ref/` contents or any RCT2 game data. `ref/` is git-ignored; it's the user's own copy for testing only. Putting assets into a tracked file or a distributable artifact = hard stop.
   - **Branch discipline:** all work on the **`ipad`** branch (or short-lived phase branches merged into it). **Never commit to `develop`** — it's the read-only upstream mirror. **Never push to `upstream` / `OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2`; never open a PR against it.**
   - **Provenance:** keep every upstream `licence.txt`, copyright header, and `contributors.md` intact. Don't rewrite `develop` history; no force-pushes to shared branches. Keep the "forked from" link.
   - **Commit hygiene:** small, reversible commits, each with a green build; prefix port commits `[touch] …` and state what changed. Never leave `ipad` red.
   - **macOS-headless-first:** prove changes in the inner loop before iOS.
   - **Attribution:** the README credits OpenRCT2 and states this is an unofficial, unaffiliated community port.
   - **Sync deliberately:** update `develop` from `upstream`, then rebase/merge `ipad` onto a chosen pinned point — never blind-merge a moving target mid-phase.
   - **Stop and ask at the human gates (§9.5).**
3. **How to build/test:** the exact `scripts/*` commands for each loop.
4. **Where things live:** the §6 file map (platform layer, UiContext, PlatformEnvironment, input/, scripting).
5. **Current phase + exit criteria:** update this field as you progress; the agent reads it to know its target.
6. **Definition of done per phase:** copy the Exit criteria from §8.
7. **Dependency manifest:** point to `vendor/MANIFEST.md`.

> Treat `AGENTS.md` as the agent's working memory; treat this `PLAN.md` as the reference manual.

---

## 11. Testing & QA strategy

- **Inner-loop regression:** headless `simulate` + `screenshot`-diff on a fixed park set, every change. Cheap, deterministic, catches logic breaks.
- **Simulator:** UI rendering, asset-import flow, input event plumbing.
- **Device-only (must):** frame rate, memory, Pencil (pressure/tilt/hover), trackpad/mouse, thermals, orientation/safe-area, real Files import.
- **Crash triage:** `idevicecrashreport` on every device session; keep a running top-crashes list in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Visual diffs need a human.** Automate the *detection*, not the *judgment*.
- **Verification agent (optional):** periodically spawn a second agent to audit the diff for regressions, re-run the full smoke suite, and sanity-check that no `ref/` content leaked into tracked files or the app bundle's distributable path.

---

## 12. Distribution & legal checklist

- **License:** OpenRCT2 is **GPLv3-or-later**. Your fork inherits it. Publish your iOS additions under GPLv3 too.
- **Public App Store: NO.** GPLv3's anti-Tivoization + "no additional restrictions" conflict with App Store terms (the VLC precedent). Don't attempt it.
- **Sideload (free provisioning):** fine for you; 7-day cert churn; 3 apps at once.
- **TestFlight:** needs the $99 program; internal testers = no review; external = Beta App Review + 90-day build expiry. Legit as a beta channel; don't use it to dodge review permanently.
- **EU alternative marketplaces:** possible post-DMA, but still require Apple Notarization.
- **Assets:** ship **none**. Users bring their own RCT2/RCT Classic data (Files import). This is both the legal position and the reason App Store distribution is moot.
- **Attribution:** keep upstream `licence.txt`, `contributors.md`; add a NOTICE crediting OpenRCT2.
- **Framing (reputational):** present as a **human-directed AI port / fork**, honestly. The RCT and open-source communities are sensitive to AI-generated code dumped upstream (the GZDoom episode). Keep it a fork; don't spam upstream with unrequested PRs.

---

## 13. Risk register (ranked) + mitigations

1. **iOS dependency cross-compile stalls (Phase 2).** *Mitigation:* isolate it before touching the engine; prefer vcpkg iOS triplets + SDL's official xcframework; record a MANIFEST; drive with the human, not autonomously.
2. **Software-renderer performance on large parks (Phase 9).** *Mitigation:* profile early on device; cap park size/view distance on iOS if needed; revisit ANGLE/Metal GL only if necessary.
3. **Touch/Pencil *feel* (Phases 7–8).** *Mitigation:* human-in-loop; copy proven patterns (Civ VI, RCT Classic, OpenTTD Android); ship keyboard/trackpad play (Phase 6) as a fallback demo.
4. **Memory ceiling / OOM on device (Phase 9).** *Mitigation:* budget memory; test long sessions; fix peaks; consider smaller default parks.
5. **Asset-import UX friction (Phase 5).** *Mitigation:* `ref/` dev stand-in for testing; polish the Files import; clear first-run guidance.
6. **Upstream drift (SDL3, engine changes).** *Mitigation:* pin the `ipad` branch's base commit; sync/rebase deliberately; stay on SDL2 for v1.
7. **Signing/provisioning friction.** *Mitigation:* start free; buy the $99 program when distributing.
8. **Community/reputational blowback.** *Mitigation:* honest framing; fork not upstream-dump; credit maintainers.

*(Not on this list: JIT/plugins and SDL-on-iOS — both debunked. quickjs-ng is a no-JIT interpreter; SDL2/3 support iOS.)*

---

## 14. Definition of done + the demo script

**Done (v1):** the MVP in §1.1 runs on a physical iPad.

**The 30–60s demo (film this):**
1. Cold-launch on iPad — OpenRCT2 title, natively. (Establish: not a stream, not a VM.)
2. Open a park.
3. **Pick up the Apple Pencil and draw a coaster track** — it snaps to real pieces; a train runs it. (Hero shot.)
4. Pinch-zoom the park; two-finger pan; tap-place scenery.
5. Load a **community plugin or custom scenario** — the instant answer to "why not just buy RCT Classic?"
6. Close line, honest: *"Directed by a human, ported by an AI agent from the open-source engine — the RollerCoaster Tycoon you grew up with, finally native on iPad, with everything OpenRCT2 adds that Classic never will."*

## 15. Appendix

### 15.1 File inventory — create vs. modify
**Create (new files on the `ipad` branch):**
- `src/openrct2/platform/Platform.iOS.mm` — path resolution for the sandbox/bundle (sits beside `Platform.macOS.mm`).
- `src/openrct2-ui/UiContext.iOS.mm` — SDL/UIKit window + input glue (sits beside `UiContext.macOS.mm`).
- Touch/Pencil/GameController input source files under `src/openrct2-ui/input/`.
- `ios/App/*` — UIKit app shell, `Info.plist`, `OpenRCT2Touch.entitlements`, launch screen, icons.
- `ios/toolchain/ios.toolchain.cmake`, `ios/cmake/*` — iOS build config.
- All of `scripts/*`, `AGENTS.md`, `README-touch.md`, appended `.gitignore`, `ref/README.md`, `vendor/MANIFEST.md`.

**Modify (upstream files, patched in place on the `ipad` branch):**
- `src/openrct2/platform/*` + `Platform.h` — register the iOS platform (or `TARGET_OS_IOS` guards in `Platform.macOS.mm`/`Platform.Posix.cpp`).
- `src/openrct2/PlatformEnvironment.cpp` — iOS branch if `GetOpenRCT2DirectoryName()`/defaults need it.
- `src/openrct2-ui/UiContext.cpp` + `input/` + `drawing/` — iOS context, disable GL, touch/Pencil/GC input.
- CMake files — add iOS target/flags (`DISABLE_OPENGL=ON`, etc.).

**Never touch for distribution:** `ref/` contents (data), any RCT2 asset.

### 15.2 Command reference (verified)
Data-path overrides (macOS/desktop): `--rct2-data-path`, `--rct1-data-path`, `--openrct2-data-path`, `--user-data-path` (all take absolute paths).
Run modes: `--headless`, subcommands `simulate <park> <ticks>`, `screenshot ...`, `scan-objects <path>`, `set-rct2 <path>` (validates `Data/g1.dat`).
iOS build/install: `xcodebuild`, `xcrun devicectl device install/process launch --console`, `ios-deploy --debug`, `idevicesyslog`, `idevicecrashreport`.

### 15.3 Key upstream references

### Closing note
The engine is portable, the plugins work (no JIT), SDL supports iOS, and the data model is already override-driven. The project's difficulty is concentrated in exactly three places — the **iOS dependency build (Phase 2)**, **on-device performance (Phase 9)**, and **touch/Pencil feel (Phases 7–8)** — and each has a clear owner and mitigation. Build the macOS keystone first, keep `ref/` sacred, and let the agent run the inner loop while you own the gates.
