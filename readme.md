## What is OpenRCT2 Touch?

OpenRCT2 Touch is an unofficial iPadOS fork of the open-source
[OpenRCT2](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2) engine. It runs as a real
ARM64 application on iPad—there is no Windows executable, x86 emulation,
virtual machine, or game streaming involved. The engine's software framebuffer
is presented through SDL's Metal renderer, while iPad-specific input translates
finger gestures into OpenRCT2's established construction and pointer actions.

The goal is a playable iPad experience that preserves OpenRCT2's scenarios,
parks, construction tools, and modern quality-of-life improvements. This
repository is currently a **source-only developer preview**. Signed development
builds run on a physical M2 iPad Pro, but there is no public IPA, TestFlight, or
App Store release.

The maintained and GitHub default branch for this fork is **`ipad`**. The
`develop` branch is retained only as an upstream mirror, and this project does
not use a `main` branch for Touch releases.

## What works today

| Area | State | Current evidence |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| Native iPad runtime | ✅ | Signed ARM64 iPadOS app, SDL Metal presentation, landscape Retina output |
| User data and persistence | ✅ | User-owned RCT2 data in the app sandbox survives build replacement and relaunch; scenarios load on device |
| Files folder import | ✅ | Standard RCT2 data imports through Files on a physical iPad, persists after relaunch, and loads scenarios; RCT Classic is also validated in Simulator |
| Keyboard and trackpad | ✅ | Pointer controls, shortcuts, text entry, scrolling, and tuned viewport zoom work on device |
| Finger controls | ✅ | Placement, path painting/removal, pan, pinch zoom, construction rotation, and native text entry accepted on device |
| Apple Pencil | — | Not supported; the current gesture model requires fingers or a hardware pointer |
| Multiplayer | — | Networking is disabled in the current iPadOS build |
| Performance and stability | 🧪 | Current play is stable; formal 30 fps and 30-minute stress proofs remain |
| Plugins/custom scenarios | 🧭 | On-device content proof and final packaging audit remain |

The verified checkpoint and remaining acceptance gates are kept in
[`docs/DEVELOPMENT-STATUS.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT-STATUS.md) and
[`GOAL-LOOP.md`](GOAL-LOOP.md).

Build 3 is signed and installed on an iPad Pro (12.9-inch, 6th generation)
running iPadOS 26.5.2 under `com.chrissotraidis.openrct2touch`. A clean install
imports user-owned standard RCT2 data through Files, retains it after a forced
relaunch, and loads a scenario successfully.

## Touch controls

OpenRCT2 Touch keeps attached mouse, trackpad, and keyboard behavior intact.
Finger controls add the smallest gesture set needed to make construction
practical on glass.

| Gesture | Action |
| --- | --- |
| One-finger tap | Primary click and ordinary UI interaction |
| One-finger move during placement | Position the construction preview |
| Double tap during placement | Confirm placement |
| One-finger hold, then drag | Paint paths, terrain, water, or clear scenery |
| Two-finger drag | Pan the park at a controlled speed |
| Two-finger pinch | Zoom the park |
| Two-finger twist during placement | Rotate supported rides, scenery, and track designs |
| Two-finger tap on a path | Remove one path segment |
| Two-finger hold on a path, then drag | Remove path segments continuously |
| Long press outside paint tools | Secondary-click action |

The thresholds, gesture arbitration, rationale, and dated decision log live in
[`docs/TOUCH-CONTROLS.md`](docs/TOUCH-CONTROLS.md).

Apple Pencil is not currently supported. It cannot reproduce the multi-finger
pan, pinch, twist, or secondary-action gestures used by this build. Use fingers
or an attached mouse/trackpad instead.

## Bring your own game data

Like upstream OpenRCT2, this project is an engine and requires original data
from **RollerCoaster Tycoon 2** or **RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic** that you own.
The standard RCT2 `Data/g1.dat` layout and RCT Classic `Assets/g1.dat` layout
are supported by the import flow. Copy the complete, unmodified installation
folder to iCloud Drive, **On My iPad**, or an attached drive before first
launch. Select the folder containing `Data`, not `Data` itself.

Standard RCT2:

```text
RollerCoaster Tycoon 2/
├── Data/
│   └── g1.dat
├── ObjData/
├── Scenarios/
└── Tracks/
```

RCT Classic:

```text
RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic/
└── Assets/
    └── g1.dat
```

If the folder exists only on your Mac, install OpenRCT2 Touch first, connect the
iPad by USB, select it in Finder, open the **Files** tab, and drag the complete
installation folder into **OpenRCT2 Touch**. In the app's picker, choose
**On My iPad → OpenRCT2 Touch → your installation folder**. The app copies the
validated data into its private `Documents/rct2` directory; after a successful
launch, the staging folder you dragged into Files can be removed to reclaim
space.

```text
Your legally owned RCT2 or RCT Classic folder
                       │
                       ▼  choose through iPadOS Files
          private application Documents storage
                       │
                       ▼
          native OpenRCT2 engine on your iPad
```

Repository safety checks reject game data in tracked files and audit every iOS
bundle before packaging or installation. Only the explanatory
[`ref/README.md`](ref/README.md) may be tracked beneath `ref/`.

## Install on an iPad

There is no downloadable public build yet. The supported installation method
for this developer preview is to build from source on a Mac and sign the app
for an iPad registered to your Apple development team.

### Requirements

- An Apple Silicon Mac.
- Full Xcode with an iOS SDK and command-line tools installed.
- CMake 3.24 or newer, Ninja, pkg-config, and Git.
- An iPad running iPadOS 15 or newer, connected by USB, unlocked, trusted, and
  with Developer Mode enabled.
- An Apple ID selected as a development team in Xcode. Free Personal Team
  builds expire after seven days and must be rebuilt and reinstalled.
- User-owned RCT2 or RCT Classic data placed somewhere accessible in Files.

### 1. Clone and check the toolchain

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chrissotraidis/OpenRCT2Touch.git
cd OpenRCT2Touch
git switch ipad

./scripts/bootstrap.sh --install
```

`bootstrap.sh` does not require game data for an iOS-only build. Continue
directly to step 2 if you only want to install the iPad app.

The following macOS/headless test is optional and is not part of the iPad
build. Run it only if you have a local RCT2 installation, then point
`RCT2_DATA` at the folder that contains `Data/g1.dat`:

```sh
RCT2_DATA="/absolute/path/to/RollerCoaster Tycoon 2" \
    ./scripts/bootstrap.sh --require-data
./scripts/build-macos.sh
RCT2_DATA="/absolute/path/to/RollerCoaster Tycoon 2" \
    ./scripts/run-macos-headless.sh
```

### 2. Build the pinned iOS dependencies

The first dependency build downloads and compiles the pinned open-source
dependency set and can take a while. Generated files remain ignored under
`vendor/` and `build/`.

```sh
./scripts/build-ios-deps.sh device
```

For an optional Simulator build, use:

```sh
./scripts/build-ios-deps.sh sim
./scripts/build-ios.sh sim
./scripts/run-ios-sim.sh verify
```

### 3. Find the connected device and select a team

List the iPad identifier:

```sh
xcrun devicectl list devices
```

List local code-signing identities with:

```sh
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

For an Apple Development identity, the value in parentheses at the end of the
identity name is the team identifier. You can also confirm the account and team
under **Xcode → Settings → Accounts**. Team and device identifiers are passed
only as environment variables; the scripts never save them in the repository.

### 4. Sign, install, and launch

```sh
OPENRCT2_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=<team-identifier> \
OPENRCT2_DEVICE_UDID=<device-identifier> \
    ./scripts/build-ios-device.sh signed

OPENRCT2_DEVICE_UDID=<device-identifier> \
    ./scripts/install-run-ios.sh
```

The device build first creates OpenRCT2's redistributable engine assets,
including `g2.dat`; it does not need proprietary RCT2 data for that step. On
later builds, after `assets/engine` has been generated once, you may set
`OPENRCT2_SKIP_MACOS_BUILD=1` to reuse those assets. The build script checks
that the complete asset set exists before starting Xcode.

The install script reruns the repository and bundle audits before installing.
The bundle contains the OpenRCT2 engine, required open-source notices, and no
proprietary RCT2 data. It also saves the device launch console to
`runtime/device-logs/OpenRCT2Touch-launch.log`.

### 5. Import your game data

1. Launch OpenRCT2 Touch and tap **OK** on the missing-data explanation.
2. When the Files picker appears, select the installation folder described in
   [Bring your own game data](#bring-your-own-game-data).
3. Leave the app open while it validates and copies the folder into its private
   Documents container.
4. Load a scenario, quit the app, reopen it, and confirm the scenario remains
   available.

If validation fails, check that you selected the installation root and that
`Data/g1.dat` or `Assets/g1.dat` exists. Rebuilding with the same bundle
identifier preserves the sandbox. The July 2026 change from the old
`org.openrct2.touch` identifier to `com.chrissotraidis.openrct2touch` creates a
new sandbox, so existing development testers must import once after updating.

### Troubleshooting

- **No device appears:** unlock the iPad, accept the trust prompt, reconnect
  USB, and rerun `xcrun devicectl list devices`.
- **Developer Mode is required:** enable it under **Settings → Privacy &
  Security → Developer Mode**, restart the iPad, and confirm the prompt.
- **Signing fails:** open Xcode, sign into the intended Apple ID, and verify the
  team can register the connected device.
- **The app stopped launching after several days:** rebuild and reinstall; free
  Personal Team provisioning is temporary.
- **The software keyboard stays hidden:** disconnect or disable the attached
  hardware keyboard. iPadOS intentionally suppresses the software keyboard
  while a hardware keyboard is active.
- **The import picker does not appear:** make sure OpenRCT2 Touch is active,
  dismiss any software keyboard, and retry. If it still fails, capture the
  device log and file an iPad-port issue.
- **The app closes immediately:** rerun `./scripts/install-run-ios.sh` to save
  the launch console, reproduce the crash, wait a few seconds, and collect the
  iPad crash report with:

  ```sh
  OPENRCT2_DEVICE_UDID=<device-identifier> ./scripts/collect-crash.sh
  ```

  Attach the console log and the newest file from `runtime/device-crashes/` to
  an iPad-port issue. A crash on a beta iPadOS release cannot be diagnosed from
  the icon disappearing alone.
- **Two OpenRCT2 Touch icons appear after updating:** builds using the former
  `org.openrct2.touch` identifier can coexist with the current
  `com.chrissotraidis.openrct2touch` app. Do not delete the older app until you
  have accounted for any saves in its separate sandbox.

## Known limitations

- Apple Pencil and multiplayer are unsupported.
- Plugin and custom-scenario loading have not yet been proven on device.
- The formal 30 fps benchmark and 30-minute stress test remain outstanding.
- This project currently provides source and development signing workflows,
  not a generally installable IPA or TestFlight build.

See [`docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md`](docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md) for the exact source
preview and binary-release gates.

# 1. Introduction

**OpenRCT2** is an open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 (RCT2). The gameplay revolves around building and maintaining an amusement park containing attractions, shops and facilities. The player must try to make a profit and maintain a good park reputation whilst keeping the guests happy. OpenRCT2 allows for both scenario and sandbox play. Scenarios require the player to complete a certain objective in a set time limit whilst sandbox allows the player to build a more flexible park with optionally no restrictions or finance.

RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 was originally written by Chris Sawyer in x86 assembly and is the sequel to RollerCoaster Tycoon. The engine was based on Transport Tycoon, an older game which also has an equivalent open-source project, [OpenTTD](https://openttd.org). OpenRCT2 attempts to provide everything from RCT2 as well as many improvements and additional features, some of these include support for modern platforms, an improved interface, improved guest and staff AI, more editing tools, increased limits, and cooperative multiplayer. It also re-introduces mechanics from RollerCoaster Tycoon that were not present in RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. Some of those include; mountain tool in-game, the *"have fun"* objective, launched coasters (not passing-through the station) and several buttons on the toolbar.

---

# 2. Downloading the game (pre-built)

OpenRCT2 requires original files of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 to play. It can be bought at either [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/285330/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_2_Triple_Thrill_Pack/) or [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_2). If you have the original RollerCoaster Tycoon and its expansion packs, you can [point OpenRCT2 to these](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/wiki/Loading-RCT1-scenarios-and-data) in order to play the original scenarios.

[Our website](https://openrct2.io/download) offers portable builds and installers with the latest versions of the `master` and `develop` branches. There is also a [launcher](https://openrct2.io/download/launcher) available for Windows, macOS and Linux that will automatically update your build of the game so that you always have the latest version.

Alternatively to using the launcher, for most Linux distributions, we recommend the [latest Flatpak release](https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.openrct2.OpenRCT2). When downloading from Flathub, you will always receive the latest updates regardless of which Linux distribution you use.

Some Linux distributions offer native packages:
* Arch Linux: [openrct2](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/openrct2/) latest release (`extra` repository) and, alternatively, [openrct2-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/openrct2-git) (AUR)
* Gentoo (main portage tree): [games-simulation/openrct2](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/games-simulation/openrct2)
* NixOS: [openrct2](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/by-name/op/openrct2/package.nix)
* openSUSE OBS: [games/openrct2](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=games&package=openrct2)
* Ubuntu PPA (nightly builds): [`develop` branch](https://launchpad.net/~openrct2/+archive/ubuntu/nightly)

Some \*BSD operating systems offer native packages:
* FreeBSD: [games/openrct2](https://www.freshports.org/games/openrct2)
